# Clash Royale Vision

Independent project using YOLOv8 (PyTorch) to detect cards and partial game states in Clash Royale.
Not fully trained - work in progress
Some relevant files regarding the current state of this specifically trained model are attatched

## Features
- Trained YOLOv8 model (`best.pt`) to recognize multiple Clash Royale cards and setup features.
- Early stage: detects cards and some setup elements, working toward full match-state recognition and interaction through DQN

## Tools
- Python, PyTorch, YOLOv8, Jupyter, OpenCV
